Thx
I can not install npm
Hello?
M
I think bootstrap template looks beautiful than vue�
Sorry for the late response
I was crazily busy preparing 9 peoples lunch.
Yes, I agree with you.
I will choose the best option.
Maybe bootstrap is better.
Ok
M
Can you tell me how to run this project?
Did you install node.js?
M
Yes
I will send you process txt
Ok
M
Please write it clearly thx

process.txt
M
I use Mac...
I will develop using bootstrap and send you a few days later, ok?
M
Ok, I have already checked, it looks not pretty but is good job for 2 days
Thanks.
Please use the template I sent to you and 4 mainly color I told you to use
M
Thx
Its my habbit to complete functionality first and then beautify.
M
Sure
Do you want me do develop backend side?
M
You mean database?
yes
or work only on frontend?
because I have no link to the system's database, I have to create my own database
No do the front-end first
M
We have MySQL database
Maybe my own sql database structure little different from the real database. It will take some time to integrate.
anyway, ok
I got what you want
M
Emm..can we discuss this later?
yes, sure
thank you for your time
